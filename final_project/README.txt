ML Final Project 
Dominic Nguyen

poi_id.py only has code for the final algorithm. ml_final_project.ipynb has the code and output to accompany discussion in the ml_final_project_responses.pdf file. Three pkl files contain the classifier, dataset, and feature list used. These files can be generated by running the poi_id.py file.
